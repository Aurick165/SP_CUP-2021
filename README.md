# IEEE Signal Processing Cup 2021
**Configuring an Intelligent Reflecting Surface for Wireless Communications**

The IEEE Signal Processing Society is proud to announce the eighth edition of the Signal Processing Cup: an exciting challenge to control a wireless propagation environment using an intelligent reflecting surface. 

An intelligent reflecting surface is a two-dimensional array of metamaterial whose interaction with electromagnetic waves can be controlled, e.g., by tuning the impedance variations over the surface. These surfaces might be used in the sixth generation (6G) mobile technology to direct wireless signals from a transmitter towards a receiver, to raise the communication performance. The goal of the challenge is to characterize the behavior of an intelligent reflecting surface based on received signals from an over-the-air signaling phase and develop a control algorithm to configure the surface to aid wireless communications.

## Detailed description

A detailed description of the IEEE Signal Processing Cup 2021 is found in the document [description.pdf](https://github.com/emilbjornson/SP_Cup_2021/blob/main/description.pdf) in this repository.

Here is brief information about the competition aspects:

**Eligibility:** Any team composed of one faculty member, at most one graduate student and 3-10 undergraduate students is welcomed to join the open competition.

**Dataset:** A novel dataset with transmitted and received signals, for different configurations, is provided for the challenge.

**Prize:** The three teams with highest performance in the open competition will be selected as finalists and will be invited to participate in the final competition at ICASSP 2021. The champion team will receive a grand prize of $5,000. The first and the second runner-up will receive a prize of $2,500 and $1,500, respectively.
